# Quantifying the Impact of Expanded Antibiotic Treatment on Cholera Outbreaks: A Theoretical and Applied Framework

## Project Description

This project combines the theoretical and applied research from two studies to explore and quantify the effects of expanding antibiotic treatment to include moderately symptomatic cholera infections. 

### Overview

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Quantifying the Impact of Expanded Antibiotic Treatment on Cholera Outbreaks:** This section focuses on assessing how expanding antibiotic treatment guidelines to include moderately symptomatic cholera infections could influence the overall burden of cholera and antibiotic stewardship. The primary goal is to quantify the impact of such a policy change on outbreak dynamics and antibiotic usage.

2. **A Theoretical Framework to Quantify the Tradeoff Between Individual and Population Benefits of Expanded Antibiotic Use:** This part of the project develops a mathematical framework to explore scenarios where expanded antibiotic treatment could be beneficial for both individual and population health. By analyzing the conditions under which treating moderate infections can decrease transmission and reduce the total number of antibiotic doses administered, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with this strategy.
